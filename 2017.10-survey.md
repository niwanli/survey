# Reference 1
## Network Slicing for Service-Oriented Networks Under Resource Constraints

### What is the problem: 

> A crucial network slicing problem

* Network slicing subjects to link and node capacity constraints

### What are the main research objectives:

* How to optimally localize the service functions in a physical network

### What did the authors do:

> For the problem itself

* Formulate the network slicing problem
* Introduce binary variable into the problem formulation
* Establish the problem's strong NP-hardness

> For solutions to the problem:

*  A penalty successive upper bound minimization (PSUM) algorithm
*  A PSUM-R(ounding) algorithm
*  Two heuristic algorithms  

### Where are the authors' innovations:

1. They consider the network slicing problem with practical constraints
2. They allow traffic flows to be transmitted on multiple paths and require that the data of any flow are processed by only one NFV-enabled node for any function in the corresponding function chain
3. They formulate the problem as a mixed binary linear program and show that checking the feasibility of this problem is strongly NP-hard in general

## A Resource Mapping Method in Cloud-based Satellite Ground System

### What is the problem:

> A problem of virtual resource management and mapping

* Virtual resources are limited

### What are the main research objectives:

* How to improve resource utilization
* How to map virtual resources to meet the task priority needs 
* How to achieve rational management of virtual resources based on mission requirements 

### What did the authors do:

* First, they gave the definition of task weights and task queue priority factors
* Then, they introduce the correlation coefficient method
* Next, they calculate task comprehensive priority measure
* Finally, they propose a resource mapping method based on multi-priority coefficient

### Where are the author's innovations:

* They not only consider the priority of the task, but also consider the relationship between resource needs and allocated resources.

## 5G Wireless Network: MyNET and SONAC

### What is the problem:

> A problem of wireless telecommunication

* The increasing demands on network capacity
* A large number of devices require always-on connectivity
* Applications demand stringent requirements such as low latency and high peak data rates
* Diversity in service requirements and service characteristics
* An emerging trend demands openness in the wireless telecommunication industry 

### What are the main research objectives:

* How to flexibly provide service-customized networks to a wide variety of services 

### What did the authors do:

* They propose a novel wireless network architecture **MyNET** and an enabling techniques called **SONAC** (service-oriented virtual network auto-creation)
* In SONAC, there are three basic functional components:
	* SDT(Software Defined Topology)
	* SDRA(Software Defined Resource Allocation)
	* SDP(Software Defined Protocol)

### Where are the author's innovations:

* They present MyNET, a service-centric and logical function oriented network architecture for future 5G WNs and a key enabling technique, SONAC
